    "Series datastructure - In pandas library the Series, being the basic, is an indexed datastructure used to store and manipulate single or multi-dimensional indexed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Series is the core data structures in Pandas. You can think of it a cross between list and dictionary. The items are all stored in an order and there's labels with which you can retrieve them. An easy way to visualize this is 2 columns of data. The first is the special index, a lot like keys in a dictionary. While the second is your actual data. It's important to note the data column has a label of its own and can be retrieved using the .name attribute.\n",

    "\n",
    "Earlier we saw a preview of how Pandas handles missing values using the None type and Numpy NaN values. Missing values are pretty common in data cleaning tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, if you're running a survey and a respondent didn't answer a question, the missing value is actually an omission. This kind of missing data is called **Missing at Random** if there are other variables that might be used to predict the variable which is missing.<br>\n",
    "Often it's found that, missing data (for eg, interest in being involved in a research study), has some correlation with other data like gender or ethnicity. If there's no relationship to other variables, then we call this data **Missing Completely at Random**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas is pretty good at detecting missing values directly from underlying data formats like CSV files. Although most missing values are often formatted as NaN, NULL, None, or N/A, sometimes missing values are not labeled so clearly. For example, social scientists often use the value of 99 in binary categories to indicate that it's a missing value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pandas read_csv( ) function has a parameter called na_values that allows us to specify the format of missing values. It allows scalar string lists or dictionaries to be used."

    "Sometimes we want to select data based on groups and understand aggregated data on a group level. We have seen that even though Pandas allows us to iterate over every row in a dataframe, it is generally very slow to do so. Fortunately, Pandas has a **groupby( ) function** to speed up such task. The idea behind the groupby( ) function is that it takes some dataframe, splits it into chunks based on some key values, applies computation on those chunks, then combines the results back together into another dataframe. In pandas this is refered to as **the split-apply-combine pattern**.<br>\n",

    "*Let's do a walkthrough of above cell...*<br>\n",
    "First we're doing a groupby on the dataframe object by the column \"cancellation_policy\". This creates a new GroupBy object. Then we are invoking the agg( ) function on that object. The agg function is going to apply one or more functions we specify to the group dataframes and return a single row per dataframe/group. When we called this function we sent it two dictionary entries, each with the key indicating which column we wanted functions applied to. For the first column we actually supplied a tuple of two functions.<br> Note that these are not function invocations, like np.nanmean(), or function names, like \"nanmean\". They are references to functions which will return single values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The groupby object will recognize the tuple and call each function in order on the same column. The results will be in a heirarchical index, but since they are columns they don't show as an index per se. Then we indicated another column and a single function we wanted to run.\n",
    "\n",
    "*****\n",
    "\n",
    "## Transformation\n",
    "\n",
    "Transformation is different from aggregation.<br>Where agg( ) returns a single value per column, so one row per group, tranform( ) returns an object that is the same size as the group.\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, it broadcasts the function you supply over the grouped dataframe, returning a new dataframe. This makes combining data later easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example :** To include the average rating values in a given group by cancellation policy, but preserve the dataframe shape so that we could generate a difference between an individual observation and the sum."

    "\n",
    "**Example :** Let's say that we have got a DataFrame of students and their academic levels such as being in grade 1, grade 2, and grade 3. <br>_Is the difference between a student in grade 1 and a student in grade 2 the same as the difference between a student in grade 8 and one in grade 9 ?_<br><br>Let's consider final exam scores these students might get on assignments.<br>_Is the difference between an A and an A- the same as the difference between an A- and a B+ ?_<br>At least, the answer is often no, when you're converting this to a percentage-based scale.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Ratio scale :**\n",

    "    + Mathematical operations such as +, -, / and * are valid.\n",

    "    + There is no clear absence of value i.e. no true zero.<br>So, operations like * and / are not valid.\n",
    "    + valid example can be like: the temperature as measured in ˚C or ˚F since there's never an absence of temperature, and 0˚ (zero degrees) is actually a meaningful value itself.\n",
    "    + The direction on a compass can be another good example, where 0˚ on the compass doesn't indicate a lack of direction, but instead describes a direction itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "> For most of the work in data mining, the differences between the ratio and interval scales might not be clearly apparent or important to the algorithm, but it's important to have this distinction clear in mind when applying advanced statistical tests.\n",

    "3. **Ordinal scale :**\n",
    "    + the order of the units is important, but differences between the values are not evenly spaced.\n",
    "    + valid example can be : A+, A are good example.\n",
    "    > Ordinal data is very common in machine learning and sometimes can be a bit of a challenge to work with.\n",

    "4. **Nominal scale :**\n",

    "    + good example : names of teams in a sport.<br>There are a limited number of teams, but changing their order or applying mathematical functions to them is meaningless.\n",
    "    > Categorical values are very common and we generally refer to categories where there are only two possible values as binary categories.\n",
